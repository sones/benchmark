sones GraphDB Benchmark Framework
(C) sones GmbH 2011

This is a benchmark framework to reproduce common use-cases and measure the behaviour and performance of sones GraphDB.

The benchmark process itself is a two-step process:

1. Generate and/or Import data
2. Execute algorithms on the graph

Because there are many different use-cases these both steps are made up by plug-ins which can be adressed using the integrated commandline.

To get more information on the currently available Import and Benchmark Plug-Ins please refer to this dedicated benchmark documentation page: http://developers.sones.de/wiki/doku.php?id=benchmarks

How to compile
===============

In order to successfully compile the benchmark project you will need the following dependencies:

- MONO 2.10.2 (mono-complete or mono-core & mono-wcf) or .NET Framework 4.0
- sones GraphDB Community Edition (in ./GraphDB folder)

In order to download the necessary dependencies you need to get the source-code of the benchmark project first with this command-line:

> git clone git://github.com/sones/benchmark.git

Now you should see something similar to this:

> Cloning into benchmark...
